Simple Quiz app with flower related questions. App validates if user's name is given and if all questions are answered and then shows the result, both on `Toast` message and displayed below the questions.

1. Reading user input (from `EditText`s, `RadioButton`s or `CheckBox`s)
2. Apply various mathematical logics (usage of `if/switch`)
3. User interaction with an app (`OnClickListener` set programatically / `onClick` method)
